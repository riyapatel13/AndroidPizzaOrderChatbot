# AndroidPizzaOrderChatbot

This is an Android application that is a pizza-ordering chatbot. When the user runs the app and goes to messages, there will be an automated message asking if they would like to order pizza. The chatbot scans for keywords in the user's response and constructs builds a pizza based on the user's preferences. After the order is fully complete, the chatbot will "order" the pizza and send a confirmation text that the pizza is being prepared.
